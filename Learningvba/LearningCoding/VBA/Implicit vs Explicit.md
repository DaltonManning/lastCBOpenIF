### Implicit vs. Explicit Mode in VBA Macros

1. **Implicit Mode**
    
    - **Definition**: In implicit mode, VBA allows you to use variables without declaring them beforehand. The data type is inferred automatically.
    - **Example**:
    `myVar = 10 ' myVar is implicitly declared, type is Variant by default`
    
    - **Risks**: Increases the chance of errors (e.g., typos in variable names), since VBA won't alert you if you accidentally use an undeclared variable.
2. **Explicit Mode**
    
    - **Definition**: In explicit mode, you are required to declare all variables before using them by using the `Dim` statement.
    - **How to Enable**: Add `Option Explicit` at the top of your module. This forces you to declare all variables explicitly.
    - **Example**:
    
    `Option Explicit Dim myVar As Integer myVar = 10 ' myVar is explicitly declared and type-defined`
    
    - **Benefits**: Helps avoid errors caused by undeclared or misspelled variables, leading to more reliable code.

To summarize, **implicit mode** is more flexible but riskier, while **explicit mode** (with `Option Explicit`) enforces variable declarations, reducing errors and improving code clarity.
