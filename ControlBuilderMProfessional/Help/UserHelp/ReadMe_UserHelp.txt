User-defined Online Help


To make user-defined online help, the following requirements must be fulfilled:

1. Your own customized help files should be placed in the "UserHelp" folder.

2. The help file must be of the Microsoft HTML help file type, and must also
   have the same name as the library or application (for example, MyLib.chm).

3. Context-Sensitive Help (F1).
   Linking between the help project and objects in libraries and applications is
   controlled by the fact that each object (for example a control module type)
   has its name specified as an A keyword, also called
   a hidden keyword (A keyword/Hidden).
 
Note that only Microsoft HTML Help files (*.chm) of version 1.3 are supported.
