substantially as described in applicable written materials
provided to you by ABB, and ABB support engineers will

your sole guarantee in relation to the Product and any

Agreement shall be limited to the amount actually paid by
you for the Product.

ABB or its suppliers shall not be liable towards any party
for consequential costs as result of upgrading from one
